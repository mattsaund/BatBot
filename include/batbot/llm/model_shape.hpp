// What a GGUF says about itself, read without loading it.
//
// Two things need to know how much room a model will want before committing to
// it: the GPU split, which fills cards in order and therefore has to know when
// one is full, and the "Dedicated VRAM only" check, which refuses a model
// rather than letting the driver spill it into system RAM.
//
// Both used to guess -- a flat fraction of the file size -- and a guess is
// exactly wrong here. Too generous and it refuses models that fit; too mean and
// it waves through ones that do not. A 32 GB model was refused on 34.8 GB of
// free VRAM because a 25% allowance invented eight gigabytes of overhead that
// were never going to be used.
//
// The real numbers are in the file. GGUF puts its metadata at the front --
// including the name, shape and type of every tensor -- ggml can read it
// without touching tensor data, and it costs about 50 ms even for a 34 GB
// model. So nothing here is estimated that can be read, and the two figures
// that genuinely cannot be (the compute buffers) are named as allowances.
